# fullstack proxy and CORS

Fullstack proxy and CORS are two concepts related to web development. A fullstack proxy is a way of connecting a frontend application (such as React) with a backend server (such as Express) by using a proxy server that forwards requests from one to the other. This can help with development and testing, as well as avoiding some issues with CORS. 

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and it is a mechanism that allows web browsers to request resources from different origins (such as domains, protocols, or ports) than the one they are currently on. CORS can prevent some security risks, but it can also limit the functionality of web applications that need to access data from different sources. To enable CORS, web servers need to send specific headers that allow or deny requests from certain origins.
